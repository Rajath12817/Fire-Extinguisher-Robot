# Fire-Extinguisher-Robot
ðŸ”¥ This project is a compact, Arduino UNOâ€“powered fire-response robot. Equipped with an IR flame sensor, it intelligently detects fire, activates a DC water pump to extinguish it, and drives motors to move toward the flame. Built on a breadboard and powered via USB, the system offers a sleek, responsive solution for automated fire detection and suppression
